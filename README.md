Whenever you are developing a silverlight solution on SharePoint 2010, one of the basic functionality you will require is the ability to select people from your Active Directory.

Sadly, I could not find a ready made custom silverlight control which I could utilize for my solution. I decided to write on my own. Rather than writing from scratch, I decided to
use the boilerplate code [provided](http://blogs.technet.com/b/speschka/archive/2011/08/09/writing-a-sharepoint-2010-people-picker-control-for-silverlight.aspx) by Steve.

This project contains a Silverlight People picker and People Chooser WebPart

See accompanying blog post for more information on how this controls is built  - [Writing Silverlight people picker control using SharePoint 2010 Client object model](http://madhur.co.in/blog/2014/01/29/silverlight-people-picker.html)
